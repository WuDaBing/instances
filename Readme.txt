1. Each of the three road networks (Sioux_0, Sioux_1, and Major) has a folder, which contains two files. Take the folder "Sioux_0" as an example. It has two files, i.e. sioux_stops.csv and sioux_time.csv. The sioux_stops.csv stores station locations of the sioux_0 road network, and the sioux_time.csv file stores the travel time distribution of the network. 

2. Python code "instances.py" is used to call the files in folders "Sioux_0", "Sioux_1", and "Major" to generate training, validation and test data sets for the three road netwoks, respectively.   

3. Detailed notes on how to generate data sets are given in "instances.py".
